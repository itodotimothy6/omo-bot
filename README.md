# Omo-Bot

A twitter bot that that checks it followers usage of the word "omo".

Status : **In progress**

## Context

"Omo" is a popular nigerian slang/pidgin phrase. It is a yoruba word which literally means "child of" but could be used as "bro". Because of it's very frequent usage in a lot of contexts, nobody knows the meaning anymore. We just use it in almost every statement lol.

## Next Steps

* Show an omo score as compared with other nigerian twitter users

* Extend to not just omo-bot's followers but to anyone that @s the bot

* Since "omo" is also a popular korean slang meaning something else, differentiate between these using previous tweets to know if this is the nigerian 'omo' before calculating a score
